# Notes
	1. Set up html 
		In the intro class its best to put the top-text class after everything and then reorder it in css.  
		Everything should have a class at this point. 

		I researched a little bit about forms and its various elements and attributes.  I've seen this in the past but definitely could use more practice with it.

		In the lesson a div with class contain has not been added.  We'll see if it is but I think it is need to create a flex-box for the other div elements, intro and main-content.

	2. Style the Typography
		Good practice to start with the typography first

		**CSS Combinators** a way of selecting an element without assigning it a class.
		-probably safer to use a class if you have control over the markup but if not this how to get around it. 
		-I'm going to use a class bc I can already tell I'm just not a fan of this.  I prefer classes on everything and keeping my css selectors as simple as possible.

		background-images 
			- It's good practice to have a background color set just in case the image doesn't load. This is especially important when your text is white
